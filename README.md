 Minecraft Schematics in 2D Layers
 This might be useful for whoever wants to have Minecraft Schematics in vanilla or survival mode, or you just like building stuff by hand.  
 This script currently reads .schem version 2 and 3, and .schematic.
 
## Instructions
 It's pretty clear how it works when running.
 Use __Arrow Key Up & Down__ to go by different layers.
 Click __E__ to open the file explorer and pick your own schematic.

## Issues
 The schematic picked and layer is not maintained for the next session.
 Picking a different Schematic, if too big, can not fit on the screen, __BLOCK_SIZE__ value can be changed at the top of the script.
 Doesn't read all kinds of schematic that exists out there.
